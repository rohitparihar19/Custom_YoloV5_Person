# Person-Detection

The real-time detection of humans is emerging as a significant trend, to successfully detecting a person in an image or video means you are building an application that will do object detection and image classification.The Detectron 2 model by Facebook is a object detection framework which is implemented in pytorch. It lets you detect objects in image data is a little different than the popular visual classification tools currently being used across many industries. 

# The How and What of Human Detection

What can you accomplish applying object detection tools to your images and video? Computer vision person detection accomplishes three distinct tasks:

1.Picks objects out of background images,
2.Proposes the objects as belonging to a certain class — humans, in this case — using a probability score,
3.Defines the boundaries of the proposed people with x-y origins and height and length values.
